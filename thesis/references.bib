The concept of QSAR has typically been used for drug discovery and development and has gained wide applicability for correlating molecular information with not only biological activities but also with other physicochemical properties, which has therefore been termed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR). Typical molecular parameters that are used to account for electronic properties, hydrophobicity, steric effects, and topology can be determined empirically through experimentation or theoretically via computational chemistry. A given compilation of data sets is then subjected to data pre-processing and data modeling through the use of statistical and/or machine learning techniques. This review aims to cover the essential concepts and techniques that are relevant for performing QSAR/QSPR studies through the use of selected examples from our previous work.},

In regards to the proteochemometric modeling we represented the chemical compounds by molecular signature descriptors and the CYP-isoforms by alignment-independent description of composition and transition of amino acid properties of their protein primary sequences. The entire training dataset contained 63 391 interactions and the best PCM model was obtained using signature descriptors of height 1, 2 and 3 and inducing the model with a support vector machine. The model showed excellent predictive ability with internal AUC = 0.923 and an external AUC = 0.940, as evaluated on a large external dataset. The advantage of PCM models is their extensibility making it possible to extend our model for new CYP isoforms and polymorphic CYP forms. A key benefit of PCM is that all proteins are confined in one single model, which makes it generally more stable and predictive as compared with single target models. The inclusion of the model in Bioclipse Decision Support makes it possible to make virtual instantaneous predictions (∼100 ms per prediction) while interactively drawing or modifying chemical structures in the Bioclipse chemical structure editor.},

In this report we extend our work from the previous investigation by using four different feature selection methods (wrapper, ReliefF, MARS, and elastic nets), together with eight learners (MARS, elastic net, random forest, SVM, neural networks, multiple linear regression, PLS, kNN) in an empirical investigation to address this question. The results indicate that state-of-the-art learners (random forest, SVM, and neural networks) do not gain prediction accuracy from feature selection, and we found no evidence that a certain feature selection is particularly well-suited for use in combination with a certain learner.},

P450s are responsible for >90\% of the metabolism of all drugs, so the computational prediction of metabolism can help to design out drug-drug interactions in the early phases of the drug discovery process. Computational methodologies have focused on a few P450s that are directly involved in drug metabolism. The recently derived crystal structures for human P450s enable better 3D modelling of these important metabolizing enzymes. Models derived for P450s have evolved from simple comparisons of known substrates to more-elaborate experiments that require considerable computer power involving 3D overlaps and docking experiments. These models help to explain and, more importantly, predict the involvement of P450s in the metabolism of specific compounds and guide the drug-design process.},

abstract = {Cytochrome p450s comprise a superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins named for the spectral absorbance peak of their carbon-monoxide-bound species at 450 nm. Having been found in every class of organism, including Archaea, the p450 superfamily is believed to have originated from an ancestral gene that existed over 3 billion years ago. Repeated gene duplications have subsequently given rise to one of the largest of multigene families. These enzymes are notable both for the diversity of reactions that they catalyze and the range of chemically dissimilar substrates upon which they act. Cytochrome p450s support the oxidative, peroxidative and reductive metabolism of such endogenous and xenobiotic substrates as environmental pollutants, agrochemicals, plant allelochemicals, steroids, prostaglandins and fatty acids. In humans, cytochrome p450s are best know for their central role in phase I drug metabolism where they are of critical importance to two of the most significant problems in clinical pharmacology: drug interactions and interindividual variability in drug metabolism. Recent advances in our understanding of cytochrome p450-mediated drug metabolism have been accelerated as a result of an increasing emphasis on functional genomic approaches to p450 research. While human cytochrome p450 databases have swelled with a flood of new human sequence variants, however, the functional characterization of the corresponding gene products has not kept pace. In response researchers have begun to apply the tools of proteomics as well as homology-based and ab initio modeling to salient questions of cytochrome p450 structure/function. This review examines the latest advances in our understanding of human cytochrome p450s.},

Modelling and simulation are computational tools that are invaluable for description, prediction and understanding these mechanisms in a quantitative and integrative way. Therefore the study of biological functions is greatly aided by multi-scale methods that enable the coupling and simulation of models spanning several spatial and temporal scales. Various methods have been developed for solving multi-scale problems in many scientific disciplines, and are applicable to continuum based modelling techniques, in which the relationship between system properties is expressed with continuous mathematical equations or discrete modelling techniques that are based on individual units to model the heterogeneous microscopic elements such as individuals or cells. In this review, we survey these multi-scale methods and explore their application in systems biology.},

abstract = {The genomics revolution has provided a plethora of data from many previously uncharacterized populations. The increase in the amount of genetic data has improved our understanding of why individuals and populations differ in their susceptibility to multiple diseases. It has also enabled researchers to identify how genomic variation, including at the Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) super-family, affects the safety and efficacy of therapeutic drugs. CYP450 metabolize ∼90\% of clinically administered drugs. Variability in CYP450 expression is known to affect the safety and efficacy of therapeutic drugs, including many used in the treatment and control of infectious diseases. There are inter-ethnic differences in the frequencies of clinically relevant CYP450 variants which affect CYP450 expression. Comparative studies of African populations have identified population structuring at CYP450 genes. This is associated with intra-African differences in the success of drug therapies used in the treatment of infectious diseases. Therapeutic drugs dominate control strategies for infectious diseases and are widely administered through mass drug administration campaigns. However, resistance to chemotherapy is spreading across endemic regions. The most common response has been to increase chemotherapeutic dosages, and administer combination therapies. However, there are few pharmacovigilance data examining how these changes influence adverse drug reactions. This review provides an overview of current knowledge of intra-Africa CYP450 variation, and the known associations with sub-optimal clinical outcomes in the treatment of infectious diseases. In addition, the potential for evolutionary approaches in the study of CYP450 variation is discussed to examine their potential in preventative medicine and intervention strategies within Africa.},

abstract = {Adverse side effects of drug-drug interactions induced by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition is an important consideration, especially, during the research phase of drug discovery. It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP isoform. In this study, inhibitor predicting models were developed for five major CYP isoforms, namely 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, using a combined classifier algorithm on a large data set containing more than 24,700 unique compounds, extracted from PubChem. The combined classifiers algorithm is an ensemble of different independent machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and na\"{\i}ve Bayes, fused by a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). All developed models were validated by 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse validation set composed of about 9000 diverse unique compounds. The range of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation sets was 0.764 to 0.815 for CYP1A2, 0.837 to 0.861 for CYP2C9, 0.793 to 0.842 for CYP2C19, 0.839 to 0.886 for CYP2D6, and 0.754 to 0.790 for CYP3A4, respectively, using the new developed combined classifiers. The overall performance of the combined classifiers fused by BP-ANN was superior to that of three classic fusion techniques (Mean, Maximum, and Multiply). The chemical spaces of data sets were explored by multidimensional scaling plots, and the use of applicability domain improved the prediction accuracies of models. In addition, some representative substructure fragments differentiating CYP inhibitors and noninhibitors were characterized by the substructure fragment analysis. These classification models are applicable for virtual screening of the five major CYP isoforms inhibitors or can be used as simple filters of potential chemicals in drug discovery.},

Systems biology aims to describe and to understand the operation of complex biological systems and ultimately to develop predictive models of human disease. Although meaningful molecular level models of human cell and tissue function are a distant goal, systems biology efforts are already influencing drug discovery. Large-scale gene, protein and metabolite measurements ('omics') dramatically accelerate hypothesis generation and testing in disease models. Computer simulations integrating knowledge of organ and system-level responses help prioritize targets and design clinical trials. Automation of complex primary human cell-based assay systems designed to capture emergent properties can now integrate a broad range of disease-relevant human biology into the drug discovery process, informing target and compound validation, lead optimization, and clinical indication selection.

abstract = {Cytochromes P450 (CYP) are a major source of variability in drug pharmacokinetics and response. Of 57 putatively functional human CYPs only about a dozen enzymes, belonging to the CYP1, 2, and 3 families, are responsible for the biotransformation of most foreign substances including 70-80\% of all drugs in clinical use. The highest expressed forms in liver are CYPs 3A4, 2C9, 2C8, 2E1, and 1A2, while 2A6, 2D6, 2B6, 2C19 and 3A5 are less abundant and CYPs 2J2, 1A1, and 1B1 are mainly expressed extrahepatically. Expression of each CYP is influenced by a unique combination of mechanisms and factors including genetic polymorphisms, induction by xenobiotics, regulation by cytokines, hormones and during disease states, as well as sex, age, and others. Multiallelic genetic polymorphisms, which strongly depend on ethnicity, play a major role for the function of CYPs 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, 2B6, 3A5 and 2A6, and lead to distinct pharmacogenetic phenotypes termed as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. For these CYPs, the evidence for clinical significance regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), drug efficacy and dose requirement is rapidly growing. Polymorphisms in CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2C8, 2E1, 2J2, and 3A4 are generally less predictive, but new data on CYP3A4 show that predictive variants exist and that additional variants in regulatory genes or in NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) can have an influence. Here we review the recent progress on drug metabolism activity profiles, interindividual variability and regulation of expression, and the functional and clinical impact of genetic variation in drug metabolizing P450s.},

Inhibitors of CYP enzymes have important roles in the treatment of several disease conditions such as numerous cancers and fungal infections in addition to their critical role in drug-drug interactions. Structure activity relationships (SAR), and three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationships (3D-QSAR) represent important tools in understanding the interactions of the inhibitors with the active sites of the CYP enzymes. A comprehensive account of the QSAR studies on the major human CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and a few other CYPs are detailed in this review which will provide us with an insight into the individual/common characteristics of the active sites of these enzymes and the enzyme-inhibitor interactions.},

abstract = {The past 60 years have seen huge advances in many of the scientific, technological and managerial factors that should tend to raise the efficiency of commercial drug research and development (RD). Yet the number of new drugs approved per billion US dollars spent on RD has halved roughly every 9 years since 1950, falling around 80-fold in inflation-adjusted terms. There have been many proposed solutions to the problem of declining RD efficiency. However, their apparent lack of impact so far and the contrast between improving inputs and declining output in terms of the number of new drugs make it sensible to ask whether the underlying problems have been correctly diagnosed. Here, we discuss four factors that we consider to be primary causes, which we call the 'better than the Beatles' problem; the 'cautious regulator' problem; the 'throw money at it' tendency; and the 'basic research-brute force' bias. Our aim is to provoke a more systematic analysis of the causes of the decline in RD efficiency.},

abstract = {To identify the structural features underlying the distinct substrate and inhibitor profiles of P450 2C19 relative to the closely related human enzymes, P450s 2C8 and 2C9, the atomic structure (Protein Data Bank code 4GQS) of cytochrome P450 2C19 complexed with the inhibitor (2-methyl-1-benzofuran-3-yl)-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)methanone (Protein Data Bank chemical component 0XV) was determined to 2.87 \AA resolution by x-ray crystallography. The conformation of the peptide backbone of P450 2C19 is most similar to that of P450 2C8, but the substrate-binding cavity of P450 2C8 is much larger than that of P450 2C19 due to differences in the amino acid residues that form the substrate-binding cavities of the two enzymes. In contrast, the substrate-binding cavity of P450 2C19 is much more similar in size to that of the structure of the P450 2C9 flurbiprofen complex than to that of a modified P450 2C9 or that of P450 2C8. The cavities of the P450 2C19 0XV complex and the P450 2C9 flurbiprofen complex differ, however, because the helix B-C loops of the two enzymes are dissimilar. These conformational differences reflect the effects of adjacent structural elements that interact with the B-C loops and that differ between the two enzymes. The availability of a structure for 2C19 will facilitate computational approaches for predictions of substrate and inhibitor binding to this enzyme.},

@article{Prathipati2006,
abstract = {In today's world of high-throughput in silico screening, the development of virtual screening methodologies to prioritize small molecules as new chemical entities (NCEs) for synthesis is of current interest. Among several approaches to virtual screening, structure-based virtual screening has been considered the most effective. However the problems associated with the ranking of potential solutions in terms of scoring functions remains one of the major bottlenecks in structure-based virtual screening technology. It has been suggested that scoring functions may be used as filters for distinguishing binders from nonbinders instead of accurately predicting their binding free energies. Subsequently, several improvements have been made in this area, which include the use of multiple rather than single scoring functions and application of either consensus or multivariate statistical methods or both to improve the discrimination between binders and nonbinders. In view of it, the discriminative ability (distinguishing binders from nonbinders) of binary QSAR models derived using LUDI and MOE scoring functions has been compared with the models derived by Jacobbsson et al. on five data sets viz. estrogen receptor alphamimics (ERalpha\_mimics), estrogen receptor alphatoxins (ERalpha\_toxins), matrix metalloprotease 3 inhibitors (MMP-3), factor Xa inhibitors (fXa), and acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AChE). The overall analyses reveal that binary QSAR is comparable to the PLS discriminant analysis, rule-based, and Bayesian classification methods used by Jacobsson et al. Further the scoring functions implemented in LUDI and MOE can score a wide range of protein-ligand interactions and are comparable to the scoring functions implemented in ICM and Cscore. Thus the binary QSAR models derived using LUDI and MOE scoring functions may be useful as a preliminary screening layer in a multilayered virtual screening paradigm.},

abstract = {Target-based high-throughput screening (HTS) has recently been critiqued for its relatively poor yield compared to phenotypic screening approaches. One type of phenotypic screening, image-based high-content screening (HCS), has been seen as particularly promising. In this article, we assess whether HCS is as high content as it can be. We analyze HCS publications and find that although the number of HCS experiments published each year continues to grow steadily, the information content lags behind. We find that a majority of high-content screens published so far (60-80\%) made use of only one or two image-based features measured from each sample and disregarded the distribution of those features among each cell population. We discuss several potential explanations, focusing on the hypothesis that data analysis traditions are to blame. This includes practical problems related to managing large and multidimensional HCS data sets as well as the adoption of assay quality statistics from HTS to HCS. Both may have led to the simplification or systematic rejection of assays carrying complex and valuable phenotypic information. We predict that advanced data analysis methods that enable full multiparametric data to be harvested for entire cell populations will enable HCS to finally reach its potential.},

Here we are summarizing the work on variations in POR related to metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics. We have compiled mutation data on reported cases of PORD from clinical studies. Mutations found in patients with defective steroid profiles impact metabolism of steroid hormones as well as drugs. Some trends are emerging that establish certain founder mutations in distinct populations, with Japanese (R457H), Caucasian (A287P), and Turkish (399-401) populations showing repeated findings of similar mutations. Most other mutations are found as single occurrences. A large number of different variants in POR gene with more than 130 amino acid changes are now listed in databases. Among the polymorphisms, the A503V is found in about 30\% of all alleles but there are some differences across different population groups.},

abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

abstract = {Adverse side effects of drug-drug interactions induced by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition is an important consideration, especially, during the research phase of drug discovery. It is highly desirable to develop computational models that can predict the inhibitive effect of a compound against a specific CYP isoform. In this study, inhibitor predicting models were developed for five major CYP isoforms, namely 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4, using a combined classifier algorithm on a large data set containing more than 24,700 unique compounds, extracted from PubChem. The combined classifiers algorithm is an ensemble of different independent machine learning classifiers including support vector machine, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and na\"{\i}ve Bayes, fused by a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). All developed models were validated by 5-fold cross-validation and a diverse validation set composed of about 9000 diverse unique compounds. The range of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the validation sets was 0.764 to 0.815 for CYP1A2, 0.837 to 0.861 for CYP2C9, 0.793 to 0.842 for CYP2C19, 0.839 to 0.886 for CYP2D6, and 0.754 to 0.790 for CYP3A4, respectively, using the new developed combined classifiers. The overall performance of the combined classifiers fused by BP-ANN was superior to that of three classic fusion techniques (Mean, Maximum, and Multiply). The chemical spaces of data sets were explored by multidimensional scaling plots, and the use of applicability domain improved the prediction accuracies of models. In addition, some representative substructure fragments differentiating CYP inhibitors and noninhibitors were characterized by the substructure fragment analysis. These classification models are applicable for virtual screening of the five major CYP isoforms inhibitors or can be used as simple filters of potential chemicals in drug discovery.},
