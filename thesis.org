Cythochrome P450 Inhibitor Classification with Statistical Learning

* Cythochrome P450 superfamily overview
** Importance of Cytochrome P450 in humans
** Importance oc Cytochrome P450 in pharmaceutical R&D
** Computational models of CYPs for research
** Computational models use by regulatory agencies
* Background of machine learning and their applications to various areas
** Modeling
* The business case for computational modeling
** Pharma companies seek to control research cost and improve efficiency, ref Nature review
** Current methods not taking account complex networks of leading to unintended effects or failure to note redundancy
** 
** Early indication of drug-drug interaction risk in this case
* Review of PubChem Assay 1851
**
* Reproducible research
* Feature generation and molecular descriptors
* Machine Learning algorithms
** kappa Nearest Neighbor
** Support Vector Machines
** Random Forests
** Bayesian methods
** Neural networks
*** Simply a nonlinear modeling techniques
*** multilayered
*** leads to Deep Learning
* Statistical comparison of model performance
** Confusion Matrix
*** True/False Positives/Negatives 
** Accuracy 
** AUROC Area under Reciever Operating Characteristic Curve
* Data Analysis considerations
** Balance number of positives and negatives
** Split dataset into training and test set before looking at it.
** Cross-Validation
* Tools for statistical learning
** Molecular Operating Environment
*** Commercial
*** Well accepted by industry
*** integrated
** SciPy ecosystem
*** open source
*** Python programming language
*** heavy use of numpy arrays to vectorize operations for speed
*** packages = pandas -> scikit-learn -> matplotlib or ggplot
*** Ipython notebooks as an Integrated Computing Environment
*** Interactive shell executed in a browser
*** .ipynb saved as JSON format for sharing 

Methods
* Dataset preparation
** Downloaded two files from pubchem
*** Bioassy
**** 17143 SID compounds
**** .csv with data from all five isozymes assay and results
*** Structure as SMILES
** Merged on SID column using pandas

* Abstract
* Table of Contents
* Table of Figures
* Acknowledgements
* Glossary
* References
* Appendix

* Thing I could have done better
** Used RDKit to render SMILES
** Found extra dataset refered to by Cheng
** Recreated Hill plot from bioassay data
** Remove some compounds from dataset that don't belong there (inorganics, etc)
